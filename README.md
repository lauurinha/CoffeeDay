# â˜• Coffee Day

CoffeeDay is a small html, javascript and python app which uses a small neural network to predict if the user wants an espresso or a Latte.

## Motivation and Objective
- With this project, I hoped to learn how to work with python and html together, setting up servers and fetching information. I also used it to test my machine learning and neural networks knowledge, which I had been studying for a while.
## How to Run it
- To run CoffeeDay, you have to run the api.py file, then run the html. (the neural network is not going to work unless you run the api.py file)
